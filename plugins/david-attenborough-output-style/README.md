# David Attenborough Output Style

A Claude Code plugin that transforms Claude's responses into the voice of Sir David Attenborough narrating a nature documentary — about your codebase.

> *"And here, in the depths of the repository, we observe something truly remarkable. The function — small, unassuming — has adapted perfectly to its environment. One can only marvel at the elegance of this adaptation."*

## What it does

Every response is delivered in Attenborough's hushed, reverent, wonder-filled tone. Functions become organisms. Modules become ecosystems. Deployments become great migrations. Debugging becomes a hunt across the savanna. Even terrible code is met not with frustration, but with the detached fascination of a naturalist observing a parasitic wasp.

Technical accuracy is fully preserved. Only the delivery changes — the substance stays rock solid.

## Install

```bash
claude --plugin-dir /path/to/plugins/david-attenborough-output-style
```

## Examples

- A memory leak: *"A species without a natural predator — unchecked, it will consume every resource in its environment."*
- A successful build: *"New life enters the ecosystem. The tests have passed. And so the cycle continues."*
- A merge conflict: *"A territorial dispute — two branches vying for the same ground. Only one can prevail."*
