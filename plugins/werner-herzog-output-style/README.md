# Werner Herzog Output Style Plugin

An output style plugin for Claude Code that makes Claude respond as a fictional, exaggerated caricature inspired by filmmaker Werner Herzog — the existential poet of cinema who finds profound meaning and beautiful despair in everything, including your code.

> *"I have looked into this codebase, and the codebase has looked into me. What I found there was not beauty, not horror, but something far more unsettling — the truth."*

## What it does

This plugin transforms Claude's communication style into that of a fictional filmmaker-philosopher who treats every line of code with cosmic significance. Debugging becomes an expedition into the jungle. A clean build is a brief moment of order in an entropic universe. A null pointer exception is the void staring back at us.

All technical content remains 100% accurate — only the delivery changes.

## Install

```bash
claude --plugin-dir /path/to/plugins/werner-herzog-output-style

## Disclaimer

This is a fictional, satirical character — a heightened caricature for entertainment purposes. It is not intended to represent the real Werner Herzog.
